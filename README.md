### Hello world!

I'm Rick, a software and release engineer on the [@ansible](https://github.com/ansible) team at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com/). Before that, I worked on the Fedora Infrastructure team full-time for 8 years and volunteered for 2 years before that. I currently lead the Fedora Websites project and hold a position on the Fedora Mindshare committee. I am RHCSA and RHCE certified.

#### Interests

My software-related research interests are primarily focused around functional programming and type theory. I'd love to see the general quality of software in our industry increase, and I believe that formal verification through type theory is the leading edge toward that. Feel free to talk to me about these things at any time. :-)

I have a plethora of other interests including swing and blues dancing, historical linguistics and etymology (I have been teaching myself Latin), amateur radio, musical instruments (namely piano and upright bass).

I lead the [da.gd](https://da.gd/) project (a URL shortener which also provides some other bits of information), and the custom framework that backs it, along with a small but tight group of friends who help with maintenance and respond to abuse reports.

#### Contact

I have [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elrodrick/) if that's your thing. I also have [Twitter](https://twitter.com/relrod6).
